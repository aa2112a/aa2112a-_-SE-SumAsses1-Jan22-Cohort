# Introduction

This MVP web application will showcase the possibility of having webapp to standardise MSISDNs (Telephone numbers) to E164 format (e.g. +447912345678) which is compatible with other corporate systems. This will ensure matching entites is done consistently with the highest chance of success.

# Evaluation
This webapp works well but is very much an MVP for what is possible. 
The final app would need the home page to be linked to an audit system to record the user and task number.
The standardising algorith would need to be changed to use the google phonenumbers library, which is used to standardise our communication entities elsewhere, but ws out of scope for this project.
